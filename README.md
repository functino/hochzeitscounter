Countdown Visualizing / Experiment
======================
I used this simple HTML-page in a game at a wedding. The task was to find people from the audience so that their combined age reaches 305. Maybe it is useful for you too....

HowTo:
==========
Open index.html (best in Chrome/Safari) you can append your target number like so : index.html#500 (would start a countdown from 500). Then press into the left bar. Each time you type a number and press enter it gets subtracted form the target number....
